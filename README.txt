What I want to do



Going from your feedback on this assignment before(saying that it was hard to track specific individuals)
I stopped sorting by efficiency on the x axis and instead kept the same individual sequentially
Changed the scale to start at 10 to give perspective of change
Added buttons to change the graph

Try unsorted
modify the colors
  Shades of grey
  Black & white
  Cool vs. warm tones
  Bold/saturated vs. pastel colors
  Colorblind aware
  Light vs. dark background and/or color negation

As we learned in the colorbrewer paper, darker means more. I will be flipping the colors going from dark to light so that higher numbers bars are darker
