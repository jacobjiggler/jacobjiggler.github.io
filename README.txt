The reason I choose this project to improve over my other previous homeworks is I felt that it didn't represent the data well last time.
All of my last few homeworks pretty much incorporated color, so I had to pick one of them. You had a lot of feedback for this homework so
I decided this would be the one I would work on.


Improvements from the last HW:
Going from your feedback on this assignment before(saying that it was hard to track specific individuals), I stopped sorting by efficiency on the x axis and instead kept the same individual sequentially
Changed the scale to start at 10 to give perspective of change
Added buttons to change the graph
Made it look nice using a pure theme
As we learned in the colorbrewer paper, darker means more. I flipped the colors going from dark to light so that higher numbers bars are darker
I also changed it to show a distribution of individuals instead of every individual. This made it easier to show trends.
I then started experimenting with more colors and took out the chopsticks as they would look horrible on certain backgrounds

Color Modification
  Shades of grey
    I felt the data was actually easier to understand using this method. It was simple and got the point across despite how boring it was.
    I feel like for my simple graph, other colors were actually unnecessary unless you were trying to pair their colors with page design.

  Black & white
    It was ugly and I didn't feel like it conveyed the difference in bars as well as greyscale or other colors.

  Cool vs. warm tones
    Cool tones seemed to blend well with the general design of my page, but because warm tones stood out it drew the reader's attention.
    In terms of cool vs warm in readability, I felt warm made it easier to spot differences in the data slightly even though I can't explain it.
    I feel it is very important to have the colors complement the rest of the page.

  Bold/saturated vs. pastel colors
    Pastel feels better on the eyes, but doesn't draw as much attention to itself on a page of information.

  Colorblind sensitive
    My original representation was fine to read by everyone as it did not change color, just intensity.
    All the sequential colors that colorbrewer showed me were colorblind safe so I intentionally took one that wasn't colorblind safe from the diverging section.
    This representation didn't really help the visualization, but it showed how you could use a colorblind insensitive palette.

  Light vs. dark background and/or color negation
    My representation colors from last time were actually better against a dark background.
    (Although I should have made the axis, and labels white to compensate)


All of this has convinced me that you should pick your colors based on interaction with everything outside the visualization if applicable.
If that's not a consideration, than you want something that's easy on the eyes, but also makes the data easy to read and analyze. For my example,
the greyscale seemed the easiest to analyze my data with.

Afterwards I realized there was a few other ways I could have represented my data with color.
I could have shown bars that increased in white, and bars that decreased in black, but I have a feeling that it would have just confused a viewer.
I also could have displayed each individual in my original chart as a differing qualitative color but that would have been a color overload.
