What I want to do

The reason I choose this project over my other previous homework is I felt it didn't represented the data well last time.
All of my last few homeworks pretty much incorporated color, so I had to pick one of them. You had a lot of feedback for this homework so I decided this
would be the one I would work on.



Going from your feedback on this assignment before(saying that it was hard to track specific individuals)
I stopped sorting by efficiency on the x axis and instead kept the same individual sequentially
Changed the scale to start at 10 to give perspective of change
Added buttons to change the graph
Made it look nice using a pure theme
As we learned in the colorbrewer paper, darker means more. I flipiped the colors going from dark to light so that higher numbers bars are darker
I also changed it to show a distribution of individuals instead of every individual. This made it easier to show trends.
I then started experimenting with more colors and took out the chopsticks as they would look horrible on certain backgrounds

modify the colors
  Shades of grey
  Black & white
  Cool vs. warm tones
  Bold/saturated vs. pastel colors
  Colorblind aware
  Light vs. dark background and/or color negation
